# An Empirical Study on LLM-based Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection: Can it Really Work?

This repository includes the dataset, the supplemented vulnerability definitions of Methods ① - ③, and the source code of the optimized model.

## Dataset
Please find the smart contracts in  [Dataset](Dataset) folder, and the  carefully-labeled vulnerabilities are stored in a JSON file [here](vulnerabilities.json).

 ## Supplemented Content Vulnerability Definitions
The Supplemented vulnerability definitions for Methods ① - ③  are stored in [dataset](dataset) folder. The prompts used in stage 3 of the optimized method are in [optm_prompt](dataset/optm_prompt) folder

## License
All the contracts in [Dataset](Dataset) folder that are obtained from public websites retain their original licenses. For all the other files in this repository, please follow the license in [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.
